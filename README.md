# Speech-Controlled-Robot
Control your robot using Windows 10 IoT Core Speech Recognition.

In earlier days of computer, interaction with computer was held via punch-cards, trackball, light-gun, keyboards and even via touch screen. All of these devices requires some kind of physical contact to operate them.

With decade-by-decade, new technology improves over the old one. Wireless input devices become popular as they provide clean and less cluttered desk. With the current enhancement in software as well as hardware, a new kind of inputs are possible which are: Visual and Speech Input.

I have written an article on hackster which will help you to learn Speech Recognition technology provided in Windows 10 IoT Core. At the end of the topic, you will create a robot using Windows 10 IoT Core and Raspberry Pi 2 running Speech Recognition application. This Speech Recognition application enables robot to perform various movement task (for ex: move forward, turn, stop, etc.) based upon user interaction by speech.
